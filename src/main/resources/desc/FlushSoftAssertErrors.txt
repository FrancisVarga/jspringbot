Flushes all soft assertion errors by throwing all captured error within the Soft Assert & Flush Soft Assert Errors block.
Note that this is only applicable for jspingbot keywords.

Example:
| Soft Assert | true |
| El Should Be True | $[1 > 0] |
| El Should Be True | $[1 > 2] |
| El Should Be True | $[3 > 1] |
| El Should Be True | $[2 < 1] |
| Flush Soft Assert Errors |

Result:
[ WARN ] [SpringRobotLibrary] [SOFT ASSERT]: (EL Should Be True) -> Evaluation '$[1 > 2]' was not true.
[ WARN ] [SpringRobotLibrary] [SOFT ASSERT]: (EL Should Be True) -> Evaluation '$[2 < 1]' was not true.
